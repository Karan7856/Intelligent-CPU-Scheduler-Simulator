# PROCESS_SCHEDULER
he Intelligent CPU Scheduler Simulator is a powerful and interactive tool designed to simulate and analyze various CPU scheduling algorithms. It provides real-time visualizations, Gantt charts, and performance metrics to help users understand how different scheduling techniques work.

Features
✅ Supports multiple scheduling algorithms:

First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)

Shortest Job First (SJF) (Non-Preemptive & Preemptive)

Round Robin (RR) with configurable time quantum

Priority Scheduling (Non-Preemptive & Preemptive)

✅ Real-Time Visualization

Gantt chart representation of process execution

Step-by-step execution tracing

✅ Performance Metrics Calculation

Average Waiting Time (WT)

Average Turnaround Time (TAT)

CPU Utilization & Throughput Analysis

✅ User-Friendly Interface

Simple input format for processes (arrival time, burst time, priority, quantum)

Clear tabular results for easy analysis
